# Azure Bill Analyzer
## What?
An online tool for processing .csv bills from Azure in order to see cost breakdowns by resource, groups, and time.

## Why?
Because I'm tired of digging through the .csv files trying to put together these figures by hand each month and the Azure dashboard doesn't help.

## Notice
This is not yet a functional tool. Quite a bit of work remains and I'll build things out as I get the time.
